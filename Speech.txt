Its been 75 years since India is independent. The country has come a long way from the days of British rule. The country has seen many ups and downs. The country has developed in many streams such as Science, Technology, Education, Health, etc. The country has also seen many political changes. But one of the major problems in our country is the gap between the rich and the poor which is increasing day by day. To solve this issue, we the students of 9th have created a website to help the poor people. We have created a website named "Cooking Lyrics" which will help the rich people to donate their leftovers to the poor rather than throwing it away.
